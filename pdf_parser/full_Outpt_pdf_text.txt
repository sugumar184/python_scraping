Everyone is sitting looking bored, the stage is occupied by children dancing to a nursery rhyme. Some people are snacking on samosas, cake with paper plates in their hands and some having Rasna/other colored cold-drink. NeerjaÕs mother RAMA [(45) classic good looks compromised 
by a constant frown] is helping the building watchman balance 3-4 snacks and samosa filled paper plates and giving him some instructions about sharing it with others.Neerja spots her father HARISH BHANOT [(48) serious looking man with gentle smile] sitting with a few same-aged men. One of HarishÕs friends spots Neerja walking 
with a bag and purse.FRIEND:Aa gayi aapki 3D.                                                                       3CONTINUED:3(CONTINUED)HARISH(really happy to see her)DaddyÕs darling daughter!

Lets get this party started, with Kaka ji !Neerja opens her bag and removes a walkman from inside and moves away as Rama places tipsy down. The camera stays on the mother as she removes the casserole in NeerjaÕs bag and removes the paratha (that Neerja hadnÕt 
eaten) and feeds it to Tipsy.                                                                       4CONTINUED:4(CONTINUED)Neerja is at the place where Sharma Sound SystemÕs DJ is

It reads ÔMy Fav Rajesh Khanna SongsÕ and puts it in one of 
the slots in the dual tape recorder connected to the speaker.She plays a song then immediately stops and rewinds it and plays it again and ÔBye Bye miss goodnightÕ starts 
playing.She pulls the first set of old people sitting in the front rowNEERJACÕmon everyone!
Neerja continues to get everyone on their feet and is not taking a no from a few people hesitant to get into the act. Her mother and Father laugh and are telling their friends that there is no point resisting. Neerja, facing the people standing is coaxing them to follow her lead and shows them Rajesh KhannaÕs steps. The 
song continues as we see the people losing quite a bit of their inhibitions and following Neerja as she continues to dance.She tells her Dad to hold her from behind and signals her mother to do the same. The people get the lead and a train-chain has been formed. People laughing, smiling, enjoying. NeerjaÕs smile and exuberance is infectious. 
Amidst all this she spots her oldest brother AKHIL mixing some alcohol from a miniature bottle into a glass. She catches him in the act. sneaking a cigarette, catches him in the act.  AKHIL (26) handsome and shy is scared of his younger sister as she has a stern look on her face. Neerja shakes her head as we see a flash and she turns in that direction to see that it is ANEESH(24) cuter younger version of HARISH BHANOT, take the picture. She pulls them both to join the train chain.Music continues, so does the laughter and Rajesh Khanna steps.                                                                        5CONTINUED: (2)4(CONTINUED)The Bhanot family looks like a happy family together as Rama begins dancing and Neerja copies her.

We can now see that Neerja has taken the two shots fired during the scuffle. Neerja smiles and tells the kids that she is right behind them and tells them to slide.
